Student Dropout Prediction using Ensemble Learning ðŸŽ“ðŸ“Š

This project aims to predict student dropouts using an ensemble learning approach to improve accuracy and generalization. By leveraging multiple classifiers, we enhance predictive performance and gain better insights into student retention patterns.

Key Highlights:

âœ… Cleaned and preprocessed 35 features
âœ… Encoded categorical variables for model compatibility
âœ… Trained multiple machine learning classifiers
âœ… Applied an ensemble approach for better generalization
âœ… Evaluated the model using precision, recall, and F1-score
âœ… Achieved an accuracy of 77%

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in addressing real-world educational challenges. Feel free to explore the repository and contribute! ðŸš€
